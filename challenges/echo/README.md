## Echo Challenge

In this challenge, you need to extract the hidden flag from the image file `echo.png`. The flag is encoded using LSB steganography.

### Steps:
1. Decode the image using your favorite tools (e.g., Python with PIL).
2. The flag will be a dynamically generated string based on the input you provide to the challenge.
3. Submit the decoded flag in the format `FLAG{your_flag_here}`.

Once you find the correct flag, enter it into the program to validate and move on to the next challenge.

### Hint:
The flag is dynamically generated based on a secret string. Try different possible inputs.
