# Layers Challenge

## Overview

The **Layers Challenge** is a Capture The Flag (CTF) style challenge designed to test your skills in encryption, encoding, and hidden information extraction. Youâ€™ll need to extract a flag that is hidden within layers of obfuscation.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, the flag is hidden across several layers of files, with each layer requiring different techniques to decode, extract, or decrypt the information. You will need to break through various layers of encoding and find the final flag hidden at the core.

### Requirements:
- Basic knowledge of encoding/decoding techniques
- Familiarity with common cryptographic techniques
- Patience and problem-solving skills

### The Flag

The flag is hidden within the challenge files, and the process of uncovering it will involve multiple steps. Each layer will lead to the next step, eventually revealing the flag.

## How to Play

1. Download the challenge files.
2. Start by extracting the first layer (file or image).
3. Decipher, decode, or decrypt the content as you progress through the layers.
4. The final layer will reveal the flag.
5. Submit the flag in the format: `CTF{flag_content}`.

## Hint:
The layers are ordered sequentially and may require a combination of different approaches to solve. Keep an eye out for embedded information and hidden patterns!

Good luck and happy hunting!
